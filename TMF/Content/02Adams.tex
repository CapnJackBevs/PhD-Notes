\section{The Adams Spectral Sequence}
This section is a short introduction to the Adams spectral sequence, which is a tool that computes the homotopy groups $\pi_n(X)$ of a spectrum $X$ from its $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$-homology for some prime $p$ (usually $p=2$). The first step is to give an Adam's filtration of our spectrum $X$, i.e. a sequence 
	\[
	X_n \to X_{n-1} \to \dots \to X_1 \to X_0 := X
	\]
	such that $X_n$ maps onto a space $K_n$ given by the wedge of suspensions of the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum of the $\mathbb{F}_p := \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$-homology, inducing a surjection on $H\mathbb{F}_p$-homolgy and with $X_{n+1} = \text{fib}(X_n \to K_n)$. We will work more generally and replace $H\mathbb{F}_p$ with an arbitrary spectrum $\mathcal{E}$.



% Thom spectrum of BO(n) gives the oriented cobordism spectrum, we can calculate the homotopy groups of this spectrum entirely using its Z/2Z homology, which we can calculate via its steenrod algebra structure.
